I recently graduated from UBC's Sauder School of Business with a Bachelor of Commerce with a double-major in Accounting and Business Technology Management. I am currently a Master of Data Science candidate at UBC, and outside of school I love to run and downhill ski, and I am passionate about climate change and water conservation.
